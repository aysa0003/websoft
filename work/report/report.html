<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Web application development.</p>
<p>Before this assignment I knew a little about Git and GitHub techniques and pages, 
    but the information about Markdown is a bit new to me. 
    GitHub has been used in prior courses. 
    However, it is my first time creating a website, because I have no prior knowledge 
    of creating websites before. I have very little experience and knowledge of web application development. 
    
    My TIL for this course section and assignment has been getting knowledge about Markdown,
     what and how it is used for web development. 
     Markdown is used to write text that will be displayed on websites. 
     For this assignment we had to fork a repo which was also the first time I did that.
