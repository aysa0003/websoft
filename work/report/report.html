<h1>A report from the course DA337B</h1>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Web application development.</p>
<p>Before this assignment I knew a little about Git and GitHub techniques and pages, 
    but the information about Markdown is a bit new to me. 
    GitHub has been used in prior courses. 
    However, it is my first time creating a website, because I have no prior knowledge 
    of creating websites before. I have very little experience and knowledge of web application development. 
    
    My TIL for this course section and assignment has been getting knowledge about Markdown,
     what and how it is used for web development. 
     Markdown is used to write text that will be displayed on websites. 
     For this assignment we had to fork a repo which was also the first time I did that.

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
<b>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</b>
<p>I have very little knowledge of HTML and CSS, I've done some small things before
    with HTML and CSS. JavaScript is, however, completely new to me. 
</p>
<b>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</b>
<p>CSS is the design, styling, coloring of the text in the website. 
    HTML is the markup language documents to be displayed on the website.
    JavaScript is a programming language which is text-based.
    JS is used bon the client-side and  also on the server-side 
    which makes the web pages interactive.
</p>
<b>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</b>
<p>The web browser and web server interact through HTTP protocol.
    On the client side, there is a request to the server for the web documents.
    This is done with an HTTP request and the web server grants and HTTP response.
</p>

<b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
<p>I learned more about JavaScript, HTML and CSS. My knowledge is very limited still,
    but getting accquainted with the environment is teaching me a lot.
    I'm getting used to the format, syntax and all of those fine things.

    I also refreshed some knowledege from previous courses, such at
    Network Applications. Knowing how web browser and web server interact.
